# Coursera_Capstone
This project was a capstone project for my IBM Data Science Professional Certificate. It shows some of my skills with Pandas, Beatiful Soup, and Machine Learning with SciKitLearn.

PLEASE NOTE!
You can view the entire jupyter notebooks on GitHub, but due to GitHub not having the functionality for embedded javascript, some of the features will not load. You may need to download the notebook for the full experience.
