    "Initially, we captured all the venues for each neighborhood. However, capturing only restaurants may give better insight for the restuarant market. One thing we may want to explore is how a model with restuarant-only venues compares to a model created with all venues. If there's a strong similarity between the two, we can have more confidence that non-restaurant venues correlate to what kinds of restaurants are in the area as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "We may also want to look at more factors than just venues. Economic factors such as income and home value may be important as well as population factors such as population desity and age distribution. We'll have to explore some further data sources if we'd like to pursue capturing those factors."
